BASIC BANKING SYSTEM

Hi Everyone.
This project was assigned by The Sparks Foundation under the Gradual Rotational Internship Program(GRIP) in which we have to make a complete website of a dummy bank.
For the frontend I have used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap and in the backend I have used MySQL and PHP.

In the backend there is a databse named **bank** which has two tables namely **detail** & **transaction**.

The above two are the screenshot of all the columns that the table contains.
